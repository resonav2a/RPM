# Netlify Deployment Guide for RPM

This guide will help you deploy your RPM application to Netlify for remote access.

## Prerequisites

- A Netlify account (sign up at https://app.netlify.com/signup)
- Node.js and npm installed locally
- Your RPM project code ready for deployment

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Install Netlify CLI

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### 2. Create Netlify Site via Web UI

1. Log in to Netlify at https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "Deploy manually" (at the bottom of the page)
4. Give your site a name like "rpm-project" (or let Netlify generate a name)
5. Write down the site name from your Netlify dashboard

### 3. Build Your Project

```bash
# Make sure you're in the frontend directory
cd /Users/carlyoukilledit/Documents/Coding/RPM/frontend

# Build the project (bypassing TypeScript errors for now)
./quick-build.sh
```

### 4. Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Deploy the site using Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --site=phenomenal-dodol-4e1d63.netlify.app
```
s

### 5. Access Your Site

After deployment completes, Netlify will provide a URL where your site is accessible.

Example: `https://rpm-project.netlify.app`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter TypeScript errors during build:

1. Use the `quick-build.sh` script to bypass TypeScript checking for testing
2. Fix the TypeScript errors in your code for production deployment:
   - Fix `Task.dueDate` to `Task.due_date` in the Tasks.tsx file
   - Run `npm run tsc` to identify other TypeScript errors

### Setting Up Continuous Deployment

For continuous deployment:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. In the Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Continuous deployment"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

## Environment Variables

Remember to set up environment variables in the Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment"
2. Add the following variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
